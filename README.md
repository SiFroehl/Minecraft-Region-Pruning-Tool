# Minecraft-Region-Pruning-Tool
Recently someone on my server decided it would be a good idea to travel towards the world border, in the process making the world size explode.
To combat this issue, this script can remove region files of areas outside a configureable bounding box around 0/0 (any rectangle).
The script then moves the region files to a "keep" and a "delete" folder respectively allowing you to stil make manual changes.
